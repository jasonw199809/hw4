1. 38 lines are drawn each frame
2. The first 10 is the x-coordinate of the first line. The second is the X-coordinate of the last line. The third line is the distance between each line.
3. The loop body run 6 times each frame.
4. Change the 10 in i=i+10 which is in the loop body. The second way is to change the i in 1 + (x.length - i.
5. Change the number in x = x.slice(-50) and y = y.slice(-50) to make the ellipse trail longer
